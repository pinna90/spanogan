# Detecting wireless signal noise in mobile radio communications using spatio-temporal AnoGAN

#### This model ensemble a set of CNN-based and LSTM- based AnoGAN in parallel to simultaneously learn the time- series features of the radio modulation signal and the shape expressed in the complex planes.
#### To design the spatio-temporal AnoGAN, we referred to two papers written by T. Schlegl et al. and M.A. Bashar et al.
#### In addition, it was implemented based on the code uploaded to github by yjucho1 and mdabachar.
